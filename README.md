# Password-Generator

# Description

This application generates a random password base on the acceptance criteria when the user selects:
- a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* THEN prompted for the next character types to include in the password
- lowercase
- uppercase
- numeric
-  and/or special characters
  
WHEN I answer each prompt and the input is validated then generates a random password.
